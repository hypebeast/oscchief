Received\r\npackets will be dump to stdout for further inspections.\r\n\r\noscchief is written in C and depends only on [liblo](http://liblo.sourceforge.net/).\r\nIt runs on Mac OS X and Linux.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\noscchief is written in portable C and runs on Mac OS X and Linux platforms.\r\nCurrently it's necessary to compile it from source. But this is easy and should\r\nnot be problematic.\r\n\r\nIn the future prebuild binaries for all supported platforms should be available.\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\n\r\nFirst, download liblo from [here](http://liblo.sourceforge.net/) and unpack it.\r\nAfter that the following steps installs liblo:\r\n\r\n\t$ cd liblo-x.xx\r\n\t$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local\r\n\t$ make\r\n\t$ make install\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce liblo is installed you can compile and install oscchief:\r\n\r\n\t$ git clone https://github.com/hypebeast/oscchief.git oscchief\r\n\t$ cd oscchief\r\n\t$ make\r\n\t$ sudo make install\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFor showing the help message execute oscchief with the '-h' option:\r\n\r\n\t$ oscchief -h\r\n\r\nThe following listing shows all available options:\r\n\r\n\tusage: oscchief send HOST PORT OSCADDRESS TYPES ARGUMENTS\r\n           oscchief listen PORT\r\n\r\n\tpositional arguments:\r\n\t    HOST: IP address of the host where you want to send your OSC message\r\n\t    PORT: Port number\r\n\t    OSCADDRESS: OSC address where you want to send your message\r\n\t    TYPES: OSC type tags. Supported types:\r\n\t        i - 32 Bit integer\r\n\t        h - 64 Bit integer\r\n\t        f - 32 Bit float\r\n\t        d - 64 Bit double\r\n\t        c - Char\r\n\t        s - String\r\n\t        T - True (no argument required)\r\n\t        F - False (no argument required)\r\n\t        N - Nil (no argument required)\r\n\r\n\toptional arguments:\r\n\t     -h - Shows this help message\r\n\r\nThere are two modes of operation:\r\n\r\n* Client: send OSC packets\r\n* Server: listen for incoming OSC packets and prints it to stdout\r\n\r\nTo use oscchief as an OSC client to send OSC packets use it as follows:\r\n\r\n\t$ oscchief send HOST PORT OSCADRESS TYPES ARGUMENTS\r\n\r\nIf you want to use oscchief as a OSC server use it with following options:\r\n\r\n\t$ oscchief listen PORT\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\n#### Client Usage\r\n\r\nThe following command sends two integer and one boolean argument:\r\n\r\n\t$ oscchief send 192.168.0.10 7028 /osc/address iTi 10 45\r\n\r\nIf you want to send only a OSC packet and no arguments:\r\n\r\n\t$ oscchief send 192.168.0.10 7028 /osc/address\r\n\r\n#### Server Usage\r\n\r\nTo listen on port 7028 for incoming OSC packets use the following command:\r\n\r\n\t$ oscchief listen 7028\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\noscchief is based on the oscdump and oscsend tools from the liblo library written by\r\nKentaro Fukuchi.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\noscchief is licensed under the terms of [The MIT License (MIT)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n\r\n\t/*\r\n\t * oscdump - Receive and dump OpenSound Control messages.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * Copyright (C) 2008 Kentaro Fukuchi <fukuchi@megaui.net>\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\r\n\t * modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License\r\n\t * as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of\r\n\t * the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\t *\r\n\t * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\r\n\t * WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n\t * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
